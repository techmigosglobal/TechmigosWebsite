## What Changed In Real Projects

The App Router reduces routing boilerplate, but teams still struggle with where to fetch data and where to place state. The best results came from deciding boundaries early.

## Practical Pattern

- Keep server components default.
- Move client state to leaf components.
- Use route segments intentionally for loading and error boundaries.

## Takeaway

Start simple, then optimize based on measured bottlenecks.
